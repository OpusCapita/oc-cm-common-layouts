### Builds
#### UMD
The default build with compiled styles in the .js file. Also minified version available in the lib/umd directory.
#### CommonJS/ES Module
You need to configure your module loader to use `cjs` or `es` fields of the package.json to use these module types.
Also you need to configure sass loader, since all the styles are in sass format.
* With webpack use [resolve.mainFields](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-mainfields) to configure the module type.
* Add [SASS loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) to support importing of SASS styles.
